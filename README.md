An attempt to demonstrate writing an adventure game interpreter using Claude 3.7 Sonnet with extended thinking

## Example prompt for Go code

```
Hi! How are you? Can you please help me create a Go commandline game interpreter for the Scott Adams text adventure game engine. The appended document "scott-adams-engine.md" describes all the information you need to do this. The supplied file "adv01.dat.txt" contains an example game data file that the game interpreter should be able to load correctly and play as a game.

Please implement this using modern golang best practices. Thank you!
